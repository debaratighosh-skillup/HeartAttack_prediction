# HeartAttack_prediction

A heart attack (Cardiovascular diseases) occurs when the flow of blood to the heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked. From WHO statistics every year 17.9 million dying from heart attack. The medical study says that human life style is the main reason behind this heart problem. Apart from this there are many key factors which warns that the person may/maynot getting chance of heart attack.

This dataset contain some medical information of patients which tells whether that person getting a heart attack chance is less or more.
I have tried to use different machine learning model to classify the  target variable using the information present in the  dataset
